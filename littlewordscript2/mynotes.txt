statically allocate memory for Line varsets.


internal functions come packaged in class or pair with data for requested number of arguments?

or 

vector is resized to n+1 at compile-time and then pass only the internal array into the Line. if Line requests last then at eval time set last element to last_eval



a=0
b=10
c=12
d=2

a=(b+c)-d ->{

variable x = b+c
a = x-d


}

For function call:

Line
{
func = lwc::func_call
data = {func_variable, arguments (in num_variable form) ...}
}

Braces are used to define a block or func variable. Any branching will use a similar system, calling in to a function.
